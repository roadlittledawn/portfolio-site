# Hi, I'm Clinton ðŸ‘‹

# Site tech

This is the repo for all professional things Clinton. My site is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The design is my own, cobbled together from various patterns / designs in recent projects.

I use [Feather](https://feathericons.com/) and [Devicon](https://devicon.dev/) for icons.

Site logo was made my [Matt Morris-Cook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmc-resume/) (aka, MMC || Cookie).

# Generate resume PDF

Repo contains a workflow that can automatically generate resume PDF. Currently only works by hitting production resume page.

# Sync career data

Repo contains a script to sync career data. This is vestigal from when career data was housed in gitconnected. I kept it around because there's a chance I create my own API to serve it. Until then, data is kept in the repo.
