## 2025-01-08: Icon System Implementation

### Progress Made
- ✅ **Icon Component Architecture**: Created unified Icon.astro component with dual-source support
- ✅ **Feather Icons Integration**: Implemented featherIcons.ts with common web app icons
- ✅ **Custom Technology Icons**: Built customIcons.ts with technology/brand logos from DevIcon
- ✅ **Social Links Enhancement**: Added GitHub/LinkedIn links with icons in site header
- ✅ **Skill Card Icon Integration**: Enhanced SkillCard component with icon display using iconName field
- ✅ **Fallback Chain Implementation**: Smart fallback from iconName → skill name → code brackets

### Component Architecture Added
```
src/components/
├── Icon.astro            - Unified icon system with fallback chain
└── icons/                - Icon system with dual source support
    ├── featherIcons.ts   - General web app icons from Feather Icons
    └── customIcons.ts    - Technology/brand logos from DevIcon
```

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Icon Sources**: 
  - Feather Icons ([feathericons.com](https://feathericons.com)) for UI elements
  - DevIcon ([devicon.dev](https://devicon.dev)) for technology/brand logos
- **Fallback Logic**: Icon component checks featherIcons first, then customIcons, finally defaults to "code" icon
- **Data Integration**: Skills use `iconName` field in careerData.json to map to specific icons
- **SVG Approach**: Direct SVG path injection for optimal performance and customization

### Migration Process Completed
- ✅ Migrated React-based icon system from old Gatsby site to Astro
- ✅ Extracted technology SVGs from legacy svgIcons.js file
- ✅ Added initial set of common technology icons (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Node.js, etc.)
- ✅ Updated careerData.json with iconName mappings for skills with available icons
- ✅ Implemented header social links using Feather icons

### Current Status
- Icon system fully functional with working social links and skill card icons
- Core technology icons migrated and working properly
- Documentation updated in CLAUDE.md with icon system architecture

### Remaining Work
- **Manual Icon Enhancement**: Some icons from legacy migration appear janky or didn't transfer correctly
- **DevIcon Sourcing**: Need to manually copy SVG values from devicon.dev for cleaner icons
- **Icon Library Expansion**: Add remaining technology icons as needed for skill coverage
- **Quality Assurance**: Review existing icons for visual consistency and update poor quality ones

### Development Process
- Using DevIcon's web interface to copy SVG inner content for clean, consistent technology logos
- Process: Navigate to devicon.dev → find desired icon → copy content inside `<svg>` tags → add to customIcons.ts
- This approach ensures high-quality, consistent branding for technology skills

### Next Steps
1. Review and improve janky icons from legacy migration using DevIcon sources
2. Add any missing technology icons for skills that need visual representation
3. Continue with remaining site features (experience page, about page, etc.)

## 2025-01-08: Experience Page Implementation

### Progress Made
- ✅ **Created Main Experience Page**: Built chronological timeline at `/experience` with clean, professional layout
- ✅ **Added Focus Tags to Work Data**: Enhanced all work experience entries in careerData.json with focus tags (writing/engineering/both)
- ✅ **Updated Landing Page Filtering**: Modified both `/software-engineering` and `/technical-writing` pages to use focus-based filtering instead of position name matching
- ✅ **Optimized Experience Display**: Configured experience cards to show summaries only (no highlights) for cleaner timeline view
- ✅ **Enhanced Component Logic**: Updated ExperienceCard component to support hiding highlights completely with `showHighlights={-1}`

### Focus Tag Strategy Implemented
- **AWS Documentation Manager**: `["both"]` - clearly combines technical writing and engineering leadership
- **New Relic Engineering Manager**: `["both"]` - team builds content tools, spans both domains
- **New Relic Software Engineer**: `["engineering"]` - pure engineering role
- **New Relic Technical Writer**: `["writing"]` - documentation and CMS development
- **Earlier roles**: Primarily `["writing"]` with some engineering freelance work

### Architecture Benefits Achieved
- **Unified Career Narrative**: Single chronological timeline shows natural progression from writer → engineer → leader
- **Focus-Specific Previews**: Landing pages now show relevant experience based on focus tags
- **Professional Presentation**: Clean summary-only format perfect for resume/portfolio sharing
- **Cross-Linking Strategy**: Landing pages link to full experience page for complete story

### Component Enhancements

- **Data-Driven Filtering**: Consistent focus-based filtering across all pages using same tag system as skills/projects
- **Timeline Sorting**: Experience properly sorted by start date (most recent first) for logical progression

### Current Status
- Experience page fully functional with professional chronological layout
