# Development Journal

## 2025-01-08: Project Kickoff & Planning

### Decisions Made
- **Framework**: Astro for static site generation
- **Architecture**: Unified site with filtered content instead of separate branches
- **Approach**: Spec-driven development with minimal styling initially

### Key Insights
- Current Gatsby setup has maintenance overhead with dual branches
- Single site approach better represents Clinton's dual expertise
- Astro perfect fit: performance + simplicity + Netlify support

### Progress Made
- ✅ Set up Astro project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind
- ✅ Enhanced career data with focus tags (writing/engineering/both)
- ✅ Created data enhancement utilities and migration script
- ✅ Built basic homepage with unified landing approach

### Data Enhancement Results
- 66 skills categorized by focus (writing/engineering/both)
- 8 projects with focus tags and featured flags
- docs-website marked as both writing + engineering (perfect crossover example)
- Management/concept skills tagged as writing-focused
- Technical/tool skills tagged as engineering-focused

### Next Steps
1. Create skills and projects pages with filtering
2. Add specialized landing pages (/technical-writing, /software-engineering)
3. Implement filtering JavaScript and URL state management
4. Test and iterate on the architecture

### Files Cleaned Up
- Removed: `public/`, `scripts/`, `node_modules/`, `gatsby/`, Gatsby config files
- Kept: `src/data/`, `src/images/`, `src/utils/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.nvmrc`

### Documentation Created
- User stories defining core functionality
- Technical specs for data structure and routing
- ADRs documenting framework choice and architecture decisions

## 2025-01-08: Component Architecture & Tailwind Migration

### Major Refactoring Accomplished
- ✅ **Complete Tailwind CSS Migration**: Replaced all custom CSS with Tailwind utility classes
- ✅ **Component Library Creation**: Built 9 reusable components with consistent patterns
- ✅ **Page Refactoring**: Converted skills.astro and projects.astro to use component architecture
- ✅ **Code Reduction**: Achieved 75-84% reduction in page file sizes through componentization

### Component Library Built
```
src/components/
├── PageHeader.astro      - Reusable page headers with slots
├── FilterNav.astro       - Self-contained filtering with URL state management
├── GridContainer.astro   - Responsive grid layouts with column control
├── CategorySection.astro - Organized category groupings
├── SkillCard.astro      - Dual-variant skill display (grid/list)
├── ProjectCard.astro    - Rich project cards with metadata
├── LevelBadge.astro     - Auto-styled skill level badges
├── RatingStars.astro    - Configurable star ratings
└── StatCard.astro       - Statistics display components
```

### Design System Established
- **Tailwind Configuration**: Custom color palette, animations, and responsive breakpoints
- **Component Variants**: Smart defaults with className overrides (Option C approach)
- **Data Transformation**: Components handle presentation logic (Option B approach)
- **Flat Architecture**: Easy-to-find component structure (Option C approach)
- **Utility Functions**: Shared styling utilities in `/utils/styles.ts`

### Performance & Maintainability Gains
- **Before**: skills.astro (638 lines), projects.astro (394 lines)
- **After**: skills.astro (160 lines), projects.astro (64 lines)
- **Benefits**: No custom CSS to debug, consistent design system, DRY principle enforced
- **Reusability**: Components work across pages with zero duplication

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Filtering Logic**: Encapsulated in FilterNav with custom events
- **URL State Management**: Browser history support with shareable filtered URLs
- **TypeScript Support**: Fixed type annotations for better developer experience
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Component Structure**: Flat `/components/` directory for discoverability
2. **Styling Strategy**: Tailwind utilities with variant props for common cases
3. **Data Flow**: Components receive processed data, handle minimal transformation
4. **Interactive Elements**: Client-side scripts in components with event coordination

### Current Status
- All existing functionality preserved with cleaner architecture
- Site performance improved through reduced CSS bundle size
- Development velocity increased through reusable components
- Design consistency enforced through component props and variants

### Next Steps for Future Sessions
1. Convert remaining pages (index, software-engineering, technical-writing)
2. Add experience/career page using component architecture
3. Implement SEO metadata components
4. Add animation components for enhanced UX
5. Create documentation for component library usage
