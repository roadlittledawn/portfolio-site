# Development Journal

## 2025-01-08: Project Kickoff & Planning

### Decisions Made
- **Framework**: Astro for static site generation
- **Architecture**: Unified site with filtered content instead of separate branches
- **Approach**: Spec-driven development with minimal styling initially

### Key Insights
- Current Gatsby setup has maintenance overhead with dual branches
- Single site approach better represents Clinton's dual expertise
- Astro perfect fit: performance + simplicity + Netlify support

### Progress Made
- ✅ Set up Astro project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind
- ✅ Enhanced career data with focus tags (writing/engineering/both)
- ✅ Created data enhancement utilities and migration script
- ✅ Built basic homepage with unified landing approach

### Data Enhancement Results
- 66 skills categorized by focus (writing/engineering/both)
- 8 projects with focus tags and featured flags
- docs-website marked as both writing + engineering (perfect crossover example)
- Management/concept skills tagged as writing-focused
- Technical/tool skills tagged as engineering-focused

### Next Steps
1. Create skills and projects pages with filtering
2. Add specialized landing pages (/technical-writing, /software-engineering)
3. Implement filtering JavaScript and URL state management
4. Test and iterate on the architecture

### Files Cleaned Up
- Removed: `public/`, `scripts/`, `node_modules/`, `gatsby/`, Gatsby config files
- Kept: `src/data/`, `src/images/`, `src/utils/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.nvmrc`

### Documentation Created
- User stories defining core functionality
- Technical specs for data structure and routing
- ADRs documenting framework choice and architecture decisions
