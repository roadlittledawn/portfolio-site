# Mobile Navigation User Story

## User Story: Responsive Mobile Navigation
**As a** mobile phone user  
**I want to** easily navigate the portfolio site on my device  
**So that I can** access all pages and external links without desktop-style navigation issues

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Mobile Header Layout
- [ ] Logo appears in upper left corner on all pages for brand orientation
- [ ] Logo remains visible and clickable (links to homepage)
- [ ] Hamburger menu icon appears in upper right corner
- [ ] Desktop navigation links are hidden on mobile viewports (< 768px)
- [ ] Header remains fixed at top of viewport during scrolling

#### Hamburger Menu Icon
- [ ] Three horizontal lines icon (standard hamburger pattern)
- [ ] Clearly visible and tappable (minimum 44x44px touch target)
- [ ] Transforms to "X" close icon when menu is open
- [ ] Smooth animation between hamburger and X states

#### Slide-in Navigation Menu
- [ ] Menu slides in from the right side of screen
- [ ] Smooth animation (300-400ms duration)
- [ ] Takes up full viewport height (100vh)
- [ ] Takes up full viewport width or majority (e.g., 80-100%)
- [ ] Dark overlay appears behind menu for focus
- [ ] Menu has higher z-index than all other content

#### Menu Content
- [ ] Contains all main navigation links:
  - Home
  - Skills
  - Projects
  - Technical Writing
  - Software Engineering
- [ ] Contains external links:
  - GitHub (with icon)
  - LinkedIn (with icon)
- [ ] Links are stacked vertically
- [ ] Links have adequate spacing for touch targets (min 44px height)
- [ ] Active page is visually indicated
- [ ] Links are easily readable (appropriate font size for mobile)

#### Menu Behavior
- [ ] Body scroll is disabled when menu is open (prevent underlying scroll)
- [ ] Clicking overlay closes menu
- [ ] Clicking X icon closes menu
- [ ] Clicking a navigation link closes menu
- [ ] Menu closes with same slide animation (slides out to right)
- [ ] Focus is trapped within menu when open (accessibility)
- [ ] Escape key closes menu (keyboard accessibility)

#### Responsive Breakpoints
- [ ] Mobile menu appears at < 768px (tablet portrait and below)
- [ ] Desktop navigation appears at >= 768px
- [ ] Smooth transition when resizing browser window

### Technical Implementation Notes

#### HTML Structure
```html
<!-- Mobile menu button (visible < 768px) -->
<button class="mobile-menu-btn" aria-label="Menu" aria-expanded="false">
  <span class="hamburger-icon"></span>
</button>

<!-- Mobile navigation (hidden by default) -->
<nav class="mobile-nav" aria-hidden="true">
  <div class="mobile-nav-overlay"></div>
  <div class="mobile-nav-content">
    <button class="mobile-nav-close" aria-label="Close menu">
      <span class="close-icon"></span>
    </button>
    <ul class="mobile-nav-links">
      <!-- Navigation items -->
    </ul>
  </div>
</nav>
```

#### CSS Considerations
- Use `transform: translateX(100%)` for off-screen positioning
- Transition on `transform` property for smooth animation
- `position: fixed` for full viewport coverage
- `overflow: hidden` on body when menu is open
- Media queries for responsive behavior

#### JavaScript Requirements
- Toggle menu open/close state
- Manage ARIA attributes for accessibility
- Handle body scroll locking
- Add keyboard event listeners (Escape key)
- Handle focus management
- Clean event cleanup on component unmount

### Accessibility Requirements
- [ ] ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- [ ] ARIA expanded/hidden states properly managed
- [ ] Keyboard navigation fully supported
- [ ] Focus visible indicators on all interactive elements
- [ ] Screen reader announces menu state changes
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards

### Animation Specifications
- **Slide-in duration**: 300ms
- **Easing function**: ease-out for natural deceleration
- **Overlay fade**: 0 to 0.5 opacity over 300ms
- **Hamburger to X**: Rotate and translate lines over 200ms

### Visual Design Notes
- **Background**: White or light background for menu content
- **Overlay**: Semi-transparent black (rgba(0,0,0,0.5))
- **Borders**: Subtle borders between menu items
- **Typography**: Consistent with desktop navigation
- **Icons**: Feather icons for external links
- **Active state**: Primary color highlight for current page

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test on iOS Safari
- [ ] Test on Android Chrome
- [ ] Test on various screen sizes (320px to 768px width)
- [ ] Test landscape orientation on phones
- [ ] Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack)
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test with slow network (animation performance)
- [ ] Test rapid open/close interactions

### Future Enhancements
- Swipe gestures to open/close menu
- Sub-menu support if needed
- Dark mode variant
- Customizable animation speeds
- Remember user's last menu state
- Breadcrumb navigation for deep pages
