# Positioning statement

Empathetic software engineering leader with a full-stack background. Builder and life-long learner. I ship resilient, outcome driven teams. And code when I have the time :)

My approach balances technical with the human. I love envisioniong what's possible and how to practically build toward it. I love prototyping, planning systems (both technical and human), and helping my teams measure and achieve success, for themselves and the business.

## Outline / Notes

Software engineering leader.

Team / culture builder

I build teams that are:

- resilient (got each other's back, growth mindset, adaptable, navigate ambiguity, safely fail/learn/improve)
- highly collaborative & communicative
- outcome driven (not just output or results).
- deliver quality on time
- highly accountable
- engaged
- enabled to do their best work
- efficient and adaptable

I love building systems - both technical and team.

I love building the structures for a

Balance team health, system health, delivering results / value on time.

Coach and grow engineers' careers.

Democratic + Coaching + bit of Servant + bit of Visionary management

Connecting and communicating with technical and non-technical people.

Another thing to mention is 3 motivators:

- Autonomy
- Mastery
- Purpose

5 conditions that increase a teamâ€™s odds of success:

- Having a real team (with clear boundaries and stable relationships)
- A compelling direction (aka, purpose)
- An enabling structure (aka, autonomy)
- A supportive organizational context (aka, autonomy and maybe some blend of the other two)
- Expert coaching (aka, mastery)

3 buckets, and levers great managers pull on

- Purpose
- People
- Process
